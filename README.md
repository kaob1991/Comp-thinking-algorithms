As this module was explicitly requested to be completed and submitted as a .pdf file and seperate .py files, these have been uploaded post-submission and are therefore best viewed by clicking through to the pdf file attached. 

## Running the python files

This can be done, if so desired on a local machine. The user may have python preinstalled on that machine, however, if not the most user-friendly way of getting python is via http://www.anaconda.org. Once this is installed the user should be able to download the files to their local machine, start python via the command line and run the files. 

** Be advised as stated in the project that the results achieved in the authors instance may vary greatly from another users.
